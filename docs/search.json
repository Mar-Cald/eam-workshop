    "text": "This tutorial is designed to provide the foundations for using evidence accumulation models on experiments involving perceptual judgements. Evidence accumulation models offer a comprehensive approach by jointly considering participants’ choices and response times. These models can also handle multiple-choice scenarios (two or more), allowing the analysis of responses in a broad range of tasks. This tutorial will introduce the rationale for using evidence accumulation models in visual perception research."
