## Decision Making - Perception into Action

-   Many decisions are made rapidly and at a low cognitive level.
-   Perception triggers stored knowledge → triggers action.
-   This process matches perception to known representations and selects a response.



## All Evidence Accumulation Models {.small-text}

EAMs assume that, upon stimulus presentation (e.g., left- or right-facing arrow), the decision maker:

- Samples noisy evidence for available options (e.g., "Should I press left or right?")
- Accumulates that evidence until a **threshold** is crossed

## Sequential Sampling Models

Could differ:

- Number of **accumulators** (e.g., single vs multiple)
- **Decision rules** (relative vs absolute)
- **Drift rate**: constant or time-varying
- **Noise**: stochastic vs deterministic
- With or without **inhibition** or **decay**

## Sequential Processing Assumption

Total **Response Time (RT)** is modeled as the sum of **three sequential stages**:

1. **Stimulus encoding**
2. **Evidence accumulation** (decision-making)
3. **Motor response execution**

Stages (1) and (3) are captured in the **nondecision time (Ter)** parameter.


::: notes
the models contain parameters controlling the evidence starJng point (allowing for a priori biases), accumulaJon rate (controlling the speed of processing), threshold/boundary separaJon (controlling the amount of evidence required to make a response), and nondecision Jme (the sum of Jme taken for sJmulus encoding and motor response production).
:::

## Relative Evidence Models {.small-text}

In **relative evidence models** (e.g., Wiener process, Diffusion Decision Model):

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
<br/>

- Decision is based on the **difference** in accumulated evidence between two options.

<br/>

- Suitable for **binary choices**.

## Absolute Evidence Models {.small-text}

In **racing accumulator models** (e.g., LBA, RDM):

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

- Each option has its own **accumulator** tracking **absolute evidence**.

- Decision is made by the **first accumulator to reach threshold**.

- Can handle **multiple alternatives** (not just binary choices).

::: notes

Although relative and absolute evidence models differ in how they conceptualize evidence, they:

- Share similar assumptions about trial structure and data quality
- Use overlapping parameters (drift rate, threshold, bias, nondecision time)
- Often reach the **same substantive conclusions**
- Provide convergent results when applied to the same data

# Noisy evidence
<br/>

A random walk is the cumulative sum of independent random variables, which in decision-making models represent the sequential evidence gathered from discrete observations of a stimulus.

## Wiener Process {.small-text .align-center}

The **Wiener process** (Brownian motion) is the foundation of many decision models. It models the accumulation of evidence as a noisy process:

<br/>
$$
x(t) = z + vt + sW(t)
$$
<br/>

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   $x(t)$: accumulated evidence at time $t$
-   z: starting point
-   v: drift rate (signal strength)
-   s: noise (standard deviation of the increments)
-   $W(t)$: standard Wiener process (Gaussian increments)

## Full Diffusion Decision Model {.align-center}
<br/>

The **Full DDM** accounts for more behavioral phenomena by allowing **trial-to-trial variability** in key parameters:

<br/>

**Drift rate**:  $v \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_v, \eta^2)$

**Starting point**: $z \sim \text{Uniform}(z - s_z/2, z + s_z/2)$

**Non-decision time**: $t_0 \sim \text{Uniform}(t_0 - s_{t_0}/2, t_0 + s_{t_0}/2)$

## Full DDM Parameters {.small-text .align-center}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%" .align-left}
**a**: decision boundary

**z**: starting point

**v**: drift rate

**t_0**: non-decision time

**s**: noise scale (usually fixed)

**$\eta$**: SD of drift rate across trials

**$s_{z}$**: variability in start point

**$s_{t_0}$**: variability in non-decision time

## Purpose of Variability
<br/>

Adding variability improves the model's ability to:

-   Capture **error RT differences**
-   Reflect **trial-to-trial attention or difficulty changes**
<br/>

However, it increases computational demands.

## Racing Diffusion Model {.align-center}
<br/>

Instead of a single process choosing between boundaries, the **Racing Diffusion Model** (RDM) uses **multiple independent diffusion processes**, one per option:

<br/>

$$
dx_k(t) = v_k \, dt + s \, dW_k(t) \quad \text{for } k = 1,\dots,K
$$ <br/>

Each accumulator races toward its threshold. The first to cross **wins**.

## RDM

Without starting point variability...

<br/>
$$
f_{i}(t|b,v) = b(2 \pi t^{3})^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2t}(v t-b)^{2}\right]
$$
<br/>
The winner is the first process to reach threshold:

<br/>

$$
g_{i}(t) = f_{i}(t) \prod\limits_{j \neq i} (1 - F_{j}(t)),
$$

## Latent Cognitive Parameters

EAMs decompose decisions into:

- **Drift rate (v)** 

- **Threshold (a)** 

- **Bias (z)** 

- **Nondecision time (Ter)** 


## Drift Rate (v)

- Reflects **evidence strength**

- ⬆ Drift → fast & accurate decisions

- ⬇ Drift → slow, error-prone

Manipulated by:

- Stimulus discriminability

- Attention/task difficulty


## Thresholds (a)

- Set before stimulus onset

- Reflect **response caution/cognitive control/bias/preference**

⬆ Threshold:

- Slower but more accurate

⬇ Threshold:

- Faster but error-prone

> Manipulate via pre-trial cues or instructions.


## Starting Point (z)

- Reflects **response bias**

- Midpoint = no bias

Deviating from midpoint:

- Favors one response:
  - Faster/more accurate for favored
  - Slower/less accurate for disfavored

Set **before** stimulus onset.


## Nondecision Time (Ter)

- Time to encode stimulus + execute response

- Shifts RT distribution **without** changing shape/accuracy

Sensitive to:

- Visual complexity

- Motor demands

> Hard to estimate precisely — often noisy across individuals.

## Use of Parameters

Compare parameters:

- **Across individuals** (e.g., young vs. older adults)

- **Within individuals** (e.g., easy vs. hard conditions)

- **With covariates** (e.g., BOLD activity, IQ)


## Core Assumptions of the Basic EAM

<br/>

- Each decision = a **single, continuous accumulation** of evidence

<br/>

- Culminates in a **discrete response**

<br/>

- Evidence accumulates from **stimulus onset to response**

## EAM-suitable tasks should

- Clearly define **stimulus and response onset**

- Present **static, constant stimuli**

- Avoid overlapping cognitive processes


## Within-Trial Stationarity

- Model parameters are **fixed within a trial**
- Evidence accumulation:
  - Constant **mean rate**, though noisy
  - No changes in stimulus evidence mid-trial

- Decision thresholds:
  - Set **before** stimulus onset
  - **Do not change** during the trial


## Within-Condition Stationarity

- Parameters are constant **across same-type trials**
- Needed for **model fitting and averaging**
- Assumes:
  - Trials of same condition reflect **same cognitive settings**
  - Participant behavior is stable

> Example: Don't change stimulus brightness mid-trial.


## Positively Skewed RT Distributions

EAMs naturally produce **positively skewed** RTs.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

dat = data.frame(rt = brms::rinv_gaussian(100000, mu = .5,shape = .8)+.2)
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = rt))+
  geom_density(fill = "orange", size = 2)+xlab("RT")+
  theme_classic()+
  xlim(0,2)
```


## Free of Contaminant Processes

Data should reflect **evidence accumulation**!

Avoid:

- Random guessing

- Fast guesses

- Attention lapses or missing responses

> Clean data = better model fit and interpretability.


## Stimulus Design

Manipulate difficulty to modulate:

- Drift rate

- Error rates (target: **5–35%**)

Avoid:

- **Floor effects** → guessing

- **Ceiling effects** → no errors to fit


## Response Modality

EAMs assume the response begins **after the decision ends**.

Best modalities:

- **Manual keypresses** 

- **Saccades** 

Avoid imprecise, slow, or delayed responses.


## Trial Structure and Event Timing

EAM tasks follow a structured sequence of events:

1.    **Cue** (optional)

2.    **Fixation**

3.    **Stimulus onset**

4.    **Response window**

5.    **Intertrial interval**

Each component affects the integrity of evidence accumulation.


## Cue

- Optional cue presented **before** stimulus onset.
- Informs participants **how** to respond (e.g., emphasis on speed or accuracy).
- May set cognitive control parameters:
  - **Thresholds**
  - **Biases**
- Can direct **gaze or attention** to a spatial location.

> Must occur **before** evidence accumulation begins.


## Fixation Interval

- Ensures eyes and attention are centered.
- Allows previous trial’s processes to return to **baseline**.
- Reduces overlap across trials.

💡 **Best practice:** Use **variable durations**, e.g.:

- Sample from exponential or pseudo-exponential distribution

- Mean ≈ 0.7 s; range = 0.2–5 s


## Stimulus Onset

- Marks the **start** of evidence accumulation.
- Assumes **constant signal strength** from onset to response.

> Any variability or delay in onset weakens the assumption of continuous accumulation.


## Response Window

- Starts with stimulus onset.
- Ends with:
  - A **response**
  - Or a **deadline**

💡 Calibrate response window:

- Long enough to allow natural responding

- Short enough to avoid strategy shifts

- Typical EAM use: **mean RT < 1.5 s**


## But… EAMs Can Handle Longer RTs

- [**Lerche, et al. (2020)**](https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0000774). Drift rate and General Intelligence: fast tasks 0.655*s* and slow tasks 3,319*s* ms.

- [**Boag et al. (2023)**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2022.11.009): EAMs used in:
  - Air-traffic control
  - Maritime surveillance
  - Forensic decision making


## Intertrial Interval

- Time between trials
- Purpose:
  - Allow participant to **reset**
  - Prevent **proactive interference**
  - Avoid **sequential effects**


## Sample Size Planning

- Critical for **parameter recovery** and **error trials**
- Key question:
  - Will you have enough **rare trial types** (e.g., errors on easy trials)?

> Example:  
200 trials × 5% error rate = **10 error trials** — often the **minimum** for fitting.


## Collecting Data

EAM modeling requires detailed per-trial data:

Each trial (row) should include:

- Participant ID

- Condition

- Stimulus presented

- Response submitted

- **RT**

Optional but recommended:
- Session/trial number

- Event timings: cue, stimulus, response, feedback, intertrial interval

💾 Stored as `.csv` or similar — allows model software to reconstruct the timeline.


## Outliers

Outliers distort model fits.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Fast outliers:**

- May reflect:
  - Premature guesses
  - Trigger failures
  
- Typically: **RT < 150–300 ms** (depending on response modality)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Slow outliers:**

- Less common to censor unless clearly implausible

- May reflect:
  - Lapses
  - Multiple evidence accumulation attempts

:::
:::::


## Identifying Fast Guessing

A principled method:

1. Sort RTs from fastest to slowest

2. Plot accuracy as a function of RT

3. Find the **"chance-performance boundary"**

4. Discard all RTs **below that point**

> Better than arbitrary 200–300 ms cutoff


## Detecting Nonstationarity


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Check for **drift** across trials:

- Correlate **RT with trial number**

- Look for trends suggesting:

  - Fatigue
  - Learning
  - Strategic shifts
  
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
Use this to:

- Exclude sessions

- Model time-on-task effects
