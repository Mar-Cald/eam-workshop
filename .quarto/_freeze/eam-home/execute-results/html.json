Evidence accumulation models offer a comprehensive approach by jointly considering participantsâ€™ choices and response times. These models can also handle multiple-choice scenarios (two or more), allowing the analysis of responses in a broad range of tasks. This tutorial will introduce the rationale for using evidence accumulation models in visual perception research. \n:::\n",
